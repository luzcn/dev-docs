## Threads and Runnable
Processes are instances of programs which typically run independent to each other, e.g. if you start a java program the operating system spawns a new process which runs in parallel to other programs. 
Inside those processes we can utilize threads to execute code concurrently, so we can make the most out of the available cores of the CPU.

Before start a new thread, you need to specify the code (behavior) to be executed by this thread. 

## Synchronization and lock

## Atomic variables and ConcurrentMap
